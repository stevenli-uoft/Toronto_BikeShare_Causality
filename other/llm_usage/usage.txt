Usage - Asking how to access embedded json files
User: Im trying to use Rs library opendatatoronto to download bikeshare station data, however I am having trouble as the json file seems to be very embedded. IN the website, it provides instructions on how to access the data in python: import requests
# Toronto Open Data is stored in a CKAN instance. It's APIs are documented here:
# https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/
# To hit our API, you'll be making requests to:
base_url = "https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca"
# Datasets are called "packages". Each package can contain many "resources"
# To retrieve the metadata for this package and its resources, use the package name in this page's URL:
url = base_url + "/api/3/action/package_show"
params = { "id": "bike-share-toronto"}
package = requests.get(url, params = params).json()
# To get resource data:
for idx, resource in enumerate(package["result"]["resources"]):
# To get metadata for non datastore_active resources:
if not resource["datastore_active"]:
 url = base_url + "/api/3/action/resource_show?id=" + resource["id"]
 resource_metadata = requests.get(url).json()
 print(resource_metadata)
# From here, you can use the "url" attribute to download this file

How can I do the same thing in R? The final url I am trying to access is "https://tor.publicbikesystem.net/ube/gbfs/v1/en/station_information", which comes from this first json layer:

LLM: Let me help you access the bike share station data using R. You can use the `httr` package to make HTTP requests similar to the Python example. Here's how you can adapt your code:



```r
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

get_bikeshare_stations <- function() {
  # Base URL for Toronto Open Data
  base_url <- "https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca"
  
  # Get package metadata
  package_url <- paste0(base_url, "/api/3/action/package_show")
  package_response <- GET(package_url, query = list(id = "bike-share-toronto"))
  package_data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(package_response$content))
  
  # Extract resources
  resources <- package_data$result$resources
  
  # Find the GBFS resource (contains real-time data URLs)
  gbfs_resource <- resources %>%
    filter(grepl("gbfs", tolower(name)))
  
  if(nrow(gbfs_resource) > 0) {
    # Get the GBFS feed data
    gbfs_response <- GET(gbfs_resource$url[1])
    gbfs_data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(gbfs_response$content))
    
    # Extract station information URL
    station_info_url <- gbfs_data$data$en$feeds %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      filter(name == "station_information") %>%
      pull(url)
    
    # Get station information
    station_response <- GET(station_info_url)
    station_data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(station_response$content))
    
    # Convert to tibble and clean up
    stations_df <- station_data$data$stations %>%
      as_tibble() %>%
      select(station_id, name, lat, lon, capacity) %>%
      # Convert coordinates to numeric
      mutate(
        lat = as.numeric(lat),
        lon = as.numeric(lon),
        capacity = as.numeric(capacity)
      )
    
    return(stations_df)
  } else {
    stop("Could not find GBFS resource in package")
  }
}

# Usage example:
try({
  stations <- get_bikeshare_stations()
  
  # Save to CSV if needed
  write_csv(stations, "data/raw_data/bikeshare_stations.csv")
  
  # Preview the data
  print(head(stations))
}) 

```

This code:

1. Makes a request to the Toronto Open Data API to get the package metadata
2. Finds the GBFS resource that contains real-time data URLs 
3. Extracts the station information URL from the GBFS feed
4. Makes a request to get the station information
5. Converts the nested JSON response into a clean tibble with station details

The main differences from your ridership data code are:

1. We're using `httr::GET()` instead of `opendatatoronto` functions because we need to follow multiple URL redirects
2. We use `jsonlite::fromJSON()` to parse the nested JSON responses
3. The final data is obtained directly from the GBFS feed rather than ZIP files

You can use this function to get the current station information. Note that this gets real-time data, so you may want to save the results if you need a snapshot for analysis.

Would you like me to modify the code to add any additional features or error handling?

User: instead of using HTTR, how can I use it using the ids using show_package and list_package_resources

LLM: I'll help you access the bike share station data using the `opendatatoronto` package functions. Looking at the resources, the bike share station data should be available through the package.



```r
library(opendatatoronto)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

get_bikeshare_stations_opendatato <- function() {
  # Get package using Bike Share Toronto package ID
  package <- show_package("bike-share-toronto")
  
  # List all resources in the package
  resources <- list_package_resources("bike-share-toronto")
  
  # Print available resources to help identify the correct one
  print("Available resources:")
  print(select(resources, id, name, format))
  
  # Get GBFS (station data) resource
  gbfs_resource <- resources %>%
    filter(grepl("gbfs", tolower(name), ignore.case = TRUE))
  
  if(nrow(gbfs_resource) > 0) {
    # Get the resource data
    station_data <- get_resource(gbfs_resource$id[1])
    
    # If the data is returned as a list, process it
    if(is.list(station_data)) {
      # Extract station information and convert to tibble
      stations_df <- station_data %>%
        as_tibble() %>%
        select(station_id, name, lat, lon, capacity) %>%
        # Convert coordinates to numeric
        mutate(
          lat = as.numeric(lat),
          lon = as.numeric(lon),
          capacity = as.numeric(capacity)
        )
      
      return(stations_df)
    } else {
      stop("Unexpected data format received from resource")
    }
  } else {
    # If we can't find the GBFS resource, look for direct station data
    station_resource <- resources %>%
      filter(grepl("station", tolower(name), ignore.case = TRUE))
    
    if(nrow(station_resource) > 0) {
      station_data <- get_resource(station_resource$id[1])
      return(station_data)
    } else {
      stop("Could not find station data resource in package")
    }
  }
}

# Try to get the data
try({
  # First print the package details
  package <- show_package("bike-share-toronto")
  print("Package details:")
  print(package)
  
  # Then try to get the station data
  stations <- get_bikeshare_stations_opendatato()
  
  # If successful, save and preview
  if(!is.null(stations)) {
    write_csv(stations, "data/raw_data/bikeshare_stations.csv")
    print("Station data preview:")
    print(head(stations))
  }
})

```

Let's break down what this code does:

1. Uses `show_package()` to get the bike share package metadata
2. Uses `list_package_resources()` to get all available resources
3. Tries to find the GBFS or station data resource
4. Uses `get_resource()` to download the data
5. Processes and cleans the data into a tibble

The main differences from your ridership code are:

1. We're looking for station data resources instead of ZIP files
2. We try both GBFS and direct station data resources
3. We print available resources to help identify the correct one

Since you're having trouble finding the right resource, could you share what you see when you run:

```r
package <- show_package("bike-share-toronto")
resources <- list_package_resources("bike-share-toronto")
print(select(resources, id, name, format))
```

This will help us identify exactly which resource contains the station data and modify the code accordingly. The actual resource IDs and formats might be different from what I assumed.


Usage - Asking how to simulate data:
User: I need to write a data simulation script that simulates my ideal data. This is my ideal datasets:
Bike Share Ridership data:
TripID, Date, start_station_location, end_station_location
Bike Lane data:
BikeLaneID, Constructed Year, Upgraded Year, Type, Location
Attached is a data simulation script I wrote for a previous paper. Follow the same structure and quality, ensuring this script exceeds the 'Simulation' component of the Paper Instructions and Rubric.

LLM: I'll help create a more sophisticated data simulation script that includes spatial components and follows the same high-quality structure. I'll also add more complex interactions between variables.

```

This simulation script improves upon the previous version in several ways:

1. Spatial Components:
- Adds realistic Toronto coordinates for bike lanes and stations
- Creates stations with higher density near bike lanes
- Includes start and end locations for trips

2. Temporal Patterns:
- Implements seasonal patterns in ridership
- Adds increasing trend in ridership over time
- Creates realistic patterns in infrastructure development

3. Complex Interactions:
- Links station locations to bike lane proximity
- Varies infrastructure type probabilities by year
- Adds upgrade probability based on lane age

4. Validation:
- Includes comprehensive data validation checks
- Tests spatial bounds and temporal ranges
- Verifies unique identifiers

Would you like me to explain any part of the simulation in more detail or modify any aspects of the code?

Usage - Spatial filtering script
User: I have two dataframes, one called bike_station which contains information on all the bike stations including ID, and its lat and Lon location. Another is bike_lanes, which contains all the designated bike lanes in Toronto, including its geographic location. I want to create a dataset that keeps only the bike stations that are within 100 meters of its nearest bike lane, based on the bike_lanes geometry column.

LLM: I'll help you create a dataset that filters bike stations based on their proximity to bike lanes. We'll need to use spatial operations from the `sf` package to accomplish this. Here's how we can do it:



```r
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(units)

# Convert bike stations to sf object
bike_stations_sf <- bike_station %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), 
           crs = 4326)  # WGS84 coordinate system

# Ensure bike lanes is in the same CRS
bike_lanes <- st_transform(bike_lanes, 4326)

# Convert to a projected CRS for accurate distance measurements
# Using UTM Zone 17N which is appropriate for Toronto
bike_stations_sf <- st_transform(bike_stations_sf, 32617)
bike_lanes <- st_transform(bike_lanes, 32617)

# Calculate distance from each station to nearest bike lane
stations_with_distance <- bike_stations_sf %>%
  mutate(
    dist_to_nearest_lane = st_distance(geometry, st_union(bike_lanes), by_element = TRUE),
    dist_meters = as.numeric(dist_to_nearest_lane)
  )

# Filter stations within 100 meters of a bike lane
stations_near_lanes <- stations_with_distance %>%
  filter(dist_meters <= 100) %>%
  # Convert back to original CRS
  st_transform(4326)

# Convert back to regular dataframe with lat/lon columns
final_stations <- stations_near_lanes %>%
  mutate(
    lon = st_coordinates(.)[,1],
    lat = st_coordinates(.)[,2]
  ) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(station_id, name, lat, lon, dist_meters)

```

This code does the following:

1. Converts the bike station data to an sf (Simple Features) object using the longitude and latitude coordinates
2. Ensures both datasets are in the same coordinate reference system (CRS)
3. Transforms both datasets to UTM Zone 17N (EPSG:32617) for accurate distance calculations in meters
4. Calculates the distance from each station to its nearest bike lane
5. Filters to keep only stations within 100 meters of a bike lane
6. Converts the results back to a regular dataframe with lat/lon coordinates

You can use the resulting `final_stations` dataframe which will contain:
- station_id
- name
- lat
- lon
- dist_meters (distance to nearest bike lane in meters)

To use this code, make sure you have the following packages installed:
```r
install.packages(c("sf", "dplyr", "units"))
```

Would you like me to add any additional features to this spatial filtering code, such as:
1. Visualization of the filtered stations and nearby bike lanes
2. Additional distance calculations or statistics
3. More detailed spatial relationships between stations and lanes?

User: I currently have 2 dataframes with processed data: bike_lanes and filtered_rides. For the filtered_rides, I added a column 'start_nearest_bikeway', which you will use to assign rides to bikeways. Attached is a glimpse of both dataframes. For more specifications, the treated bikeways treatment year will be the value UPGRADED if it has an upgrade value, or if UPGRADED = 0 (No upgrades), it will be the INSTALLED value. For example: (INSTALLED >= 2019 & INSTALLED <= 2021) |  (UPGRADED >= 2019 & UPGRADED <= 2021). This will ensure that I have 2 years of pre and post period analysis.

LLM: I'll help you create the final dataframe for your diff-in-diff analysis. Let's break this down into steps.



```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Step 1: Determine treatment status and year for each bikeway
treated_bikeways <- bike_lanes %>%
  mutate(
    # Determine treatment year (either UPGRADED or INSTALLED if no upgrade)
    treatment_year = case_when(
      UPGRADED > 0 ~ UPGRADED,
      TRUE ~ INSTALLED
    ),
    # Flag if bikeway was treated in our window of interest
    is_treated = treatment_year >= 2019 & treatment_year <= 2021
  ) %>%
  select(bikeway_id = OBJECTID, treatment_year, is_treated)

# Step 2: Create annual ride counts for each bikeway
annual_rides <- filtered_rides %>%
  mutate(
    calendar_year = year(start_date)
  ) %>%
  # Group by bikeway and year to count rides
  group_by(start_nearest_bikeway, calendar_year) %>%
  summarize(
    annual_rides = n(),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Step 3: Create the panel dataset with relative years
final_df <- treated_bikeways %>%
  # Create rows for each year for each bikeway
  crossing(calendar_year = 2017:2023) %>%
  # Join with the ride counts
  left_join(
    annual_rides,
    by = c("bikeway_id" = "start_nearest_bikeway", "calendar_year")
  ) %>%
  # Calculate relative year
  mutate(
    relative_year = calendar_year - treatment_year,
    # Only keep observations within our window
    in_window = relative_year >= -2 & relative_year <= 2,
    # Replace missing ride counts with 0
    annual_rides = replace_na(annual_rides, 0)
  ) %>%
  # Filter to keep only observations within our analysis window
  filter(in_window) %>%
  # Select and arrange final columns
  select(
    bikeway_id,
    relative_year,
    calendar_year,
    treatment = is_treated,
    annual_rides
  ) %>%
  arrange(bikeway_id, calendar_year)

# Display sample of the final dataset
head(final_df, 10)

# Summary statistics
summary_stats <- final_df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarize(
    n_bikeways = n_distinct(bikeway_id),
    avg_annual_rides = mean(annual_rides),
    total_observations = n()
  )

print("Summary Statistics:")
print(summary_stats)

```

This code will create a balanced panel dataset suitable for diff-in-diff analysis. A few key points about the code:

1. It determines treatment status based on both UPGRADED and INSTALLED dates
2. It creates relative years centered around the treatment year
3. It includes control bikeways for the same time periods
4. It handles missing values by replacing them with 0 (assuming no rides means 0 rides)

You may want to add a few validations to ensure the data looks correct:

```r
# Check balance of the panel
final_df %>%
  group_by(bikeway_id) %>%
  summarize(
    n_years = n(),

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional data cleaning steps?
2. Include code for parallel trends testing?
3. Add weather data integration?
4. Create visualization code to validate the treatment assignment?

User: I noticed there's many duplicates especially with the control bikeway data. Let's simplify our data requirements by simplifying the control group data. Since there's only really 3 different period of analysis, 2017-2021, 2018-2022, and 2019-2023, for all the treatment years (2019, 2020, and 2021), we can simplify our control data. The treatment data will remain the same, but for the control bikeways (bikeways that were constructed or upgraded before 2017), we can just split them into 3 separate periods. 1/3 of control bikeways data will be from 2017 to 2021, another third will be from 2018 to 2022, and the last this will be from 2019 to 2023. This will ensure there's an equal amount of control data for each relevant treatment period of analysis.

LLM: Great idea! This will make the analysis cleaner and avoid duplicate control observations. Let's modify the code to implement this approach.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Step 1: Identify treatment and control bikeways
bikeway_status <- bike_lanes %>%
  mutate(
    # Determine treatment year (either UPGRADED or INSTALLED if no upgrade)
    treatment_year = case_when(
      UPGRADED > 0 ~ UPGRADED,
      TRUE ~ INSTALLED
    ),
    # Flag if bikeway was treated in our window of interest (2019-2021)
    is_treated = treatment_year >= 2019 & treatment_year <= 2021,
    # Flag control bikeways (not constructed/upgraded during study period)
    is_control = (INSTALLED < 2017 & (UPGRADED == 0 | UPGRADED < 2017))
  ) %>%
  select(bikeway_id = OBJECTID, treatment_year, is_treated, is_control)

# Step 2: Get annual rides for each bikeway
annual_rides <- filtered_rides %>%
  mutate(calendar_year = year(start_date)) %>%
  group_by(start_nearest_bikeway, calendar_year) %>%
  summarize(
    annual_rides = n(),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Step 3: Create treatment dataset
treatment_data <- bikeway_status %>%
  filter(is_treated) %>%
  mutate(
    analysis_period = case_when(
      treatment_year == 2019 ~ "2017-2021",
      treatment_year == 2020 ~ "2018-2022",
      treatment_year == 2021 ~ "2019-2023"
    )
  ) %>%
  crossing(relative_year = -2:2) %>%
  mutate(
    calendar_year = treatment_year + relative_year,
    treatment = TRUE
  )

# Step 4: Create evenly distributed control dataset
control_data <- bikeway_status %>%
  filter(is_control) %>%
  # Randomly assign control bikeways to analysis periods
  mutate(
    analysis_period = sample(
      c("2017-2021", "2018-2022", "2019-2023"),
      n(),
      replace = TRUE,
      prob = c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)
    )
  ) %>%
  crossing(relative_year = -2:2) %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate calendar_year based on analysis period
    calendar_year = case_when(
      analysis_period == "2017-2021" ~ 2019 + relative_year,
      analysis_period == "2018-2022" ~ 2020 + relative_year,
      analysis_period == "2019-2023" ~ 2021 + relative_year
    ),
    treatment = FALSE
  )

# Step 5: Combine and finalize dataset
final_df <- bind_rows(treatment_data, control_data) %>%
  left_join(
    annual_rides,
    by = c("bikeway_id" = "start_nearest_bikeway", "calendar_year")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    annual_rides = replace_na(annual_rides, 0)
  ) %>%
  arrange(analysis_period, treatment, bikeway_id, calendar_year)

# Display summary statistics
print("Dataset Structure:")
final_df %>%
  group_by(analysis_period, treatment) %>%
  summarize(
    n_bikeways = n_distinct(bikeway_id),
    n_observations = n(),
    avg_rides = mean(annual_rides),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  print()

# Validation checks
print("\nValidation Checks:")

# 1. Check distribution of control bikeways across periods
cat("\n1. Distribution of control bikeways across analysis periods:\n")
final_df %>%
  filter(!treatment) %>%
  group_by(analysis_period) %>%
  summarize(
    n_control_bikeways = n_distinct(bikeway_id)
  ) %>%
  print()

# 2. Check completeness of data
cat("\n2. Years of data per bikeway:\n")
final_df %>%
  group_by(bikeway_id, treatment) %>%
  summarize(
    n_years = n(),
    min_year = min(calendar_year),
    max_year = max(calendar_year),
    .groups = 'drop'
  ) %>%
  group_by(treatment, n_years) %>%
  summarize(n_bikeways = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  print()

# 3. Sample of final dataset
cat("\n3. Sample of final dataset:\n")
final_df %>%
  arrange(analysis_period, treatment, bikeway_id, calendar_year) %>%
  head(15) %>%
  print()

# Optional: Visual check of distribution
ggplot(final_df, aes(x = calendar_year, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~analysis_period) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Observations Across Years",
       x = "Calendar Year",
       y = "Count of Observations") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Key features of this simplified approach:

1. **Treatment Data**:
   - Maintains original structure for treated bikeways
   - Each treated bikeway has its proper ±2 years around treatment

2. **Control Data**:
   - Control bikeways are evenly split into three analysis periods
   - No duplicate control observations
   - Each control bikeway appears in only one analysis period

3. **Analysis Periods**:
   - 2017-2021 (matching 2019 treatments)
   - 2018-2022 (matching 2020 treatments)
   - 2019-2023 (matching 2021 treatments)

Would you like me to:
1. Add code for parallel trends testing with this new structure?
2. Include additional validation checks?
3. Add weather or other control variables?
4. Create visualizations to compare treatment and control groups?


User: 03-clean_data.R script follows the procedures outlined in Data Processing Steps. The final dataset it creates are total annual bike rides for each bike way, with 5 years per bike way. I want the script to be adjusted so that the pre and post periods are at monthly frequency, for +-24 months, while the treatment year, will still be an entire year. 
So for more context. In the bike_lanes data, we only know the year the bike lane was upgraded or installed, not the month. Because of this limitations, the treatment will be the entire year. But for the pre and post periods, we will have the monthly total riderships the last 24, and next 24 months.
For example, if a bikeway was upgraded in 2020, then its treatment year is 2020. The post analysis period will be 2021-january to 2022-december, and the pre analysis period will be 2018-january to 2019-december. 
Modify the 03-clean_data.R script with these changes in mind.

LLM: I'll help modify the script to work with monthly frequency for pre/post periods while maintaining annual treatment periods. Here's how we can make these changes:



Let me first test some key changes using the analysis tool:

The date logic works as expected. Now I'll create a modified version of the R script that implements these changes:

Key changes made to the script:

1. Changed ride aggregation from annual to monthly frequency in Step 2
2. Modified the treatment and control data creation to include:
   - 24 months pre-treatment (monthly frequency)
   - Treatment year (all months in treatment year)
   - 24 months post-treatment (monthly frequency)
3. Added relative_month calculation to track months relative to treatment period
4. Maintained the analysis_period grouping for consistent treatment assignment
5. Updated the final dataset to include monthly rides instead of annual

The new script will create a more granular dataset with these features:
- Each row represents a bikeway-month observation
- Pre/post periods have monthly frequency (24 months each)
- Treatment period spans all months in the treatment year
- Relative_month variable shows distance from treatment in months
- Treatment and control groups are balanced across analysis periods

The output CSV (final_df_monthly.csv) will contain all these fields while maintaining the same overall structure and analysis approach as the original script.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this modified version of the script?


Usage - DiD implementation
User: How do I implement a DiD model using foels from fixest in R

LLM: To implement a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model using the `fixest` package in R, including a parallel trend test, placebo test, and heterogeneous effects analysis, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install and Load Required Packages
Make sure you have `fixest` and `data.table` packages installed.

```R
install.packages("fixest")
install.packages("data.table")
library(fixest)
library(data.table)
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Data
Your dataset should include:
- A treatment indicator (`treat`) indicating treated units.
- A post-treatment indicator (`post`) for time periods after treatment.
- A variable for the dependent outcome.
- Other relevant variables for controls and group/time indicators.

For example:
```R
set.seed(123)
data <- data.table(
  id = rep(1:100, each = 10),
  time = rep(1:10, times = 100),
  treat = rep(0:1, each = 500),
  post = c(rep(0, 500), rep(1, 500)),
  y = rnorm(1000)
)
data[, interaction := treat * post]
```

### Step 3: Estimate the DiD Model
Use `fixest::feols` to estimate the DiD model:

```R
did_model <- feols(y ~ treat * post | id + time, data = data)
summary(did_model)
```

Here:
- `y ~ treat * post` specifies the interaction term as the key DiD coefficient.
- `| id + time` adds fixed effects for individual (`id`) and time periods (`time`).

### Step 4: Parallel Trends Test
To test the parallel trends assumption, include leads and lags of the treatment:

```R
data[, treat_lead := ifelse(treat == 1 & time < 5, 1, 0)]
data[, treat_lag := ifelse(treat == 1 & time > 5, 1, 0)]

parallel_trend_test <- feols(y ~ treat_lead + treat_lag + interaction | id + time, data = data)
summary(parallel_trend_test)
```

Inspect the coefficients of `treat_lead` to check for any pre-treatment effects. If they are not statistically significant, it supports the parallel trends assumption.

### Step 5: Placebo Test
Shift the treatment time artificially to verify robustness:

```R
data[, placebo_post := c(rep(0, 700), rep(1, 300))]  # Artificial post-treatment period
data[, placebo_interaction := treat * placebo_post]

placebo_model <- feols(y ~ placebo_interaction | id + time, data = data)
summary(placebo_model)
```

A statistically insignificant coefficient for the placebo interaction term supports the model's validity.

### Step 6: Heterogeneous Effects Test
To analyze heterogeneity, include interaction terms with group characteristics, e.g., `group_var`.

```R
data[, group_var := sample(1:2, size = nrow(data), replace = TRUE)]  # Random group
data[, group_interaction := interaction * group_var]

heterogeneity_model <- feols(y ~ interaction + group_interaction | id + time, data = data)
summary(heterogeneity_model)
```

Look at the coefficients for `group_interaction` to understand heterogeneous treatment effects by `group_var`.

### Step 7: Visualize Event Study (Optional)
To visualize time dynamics (e.g., event study):

```R
event_study <- feols(y ~ i(time, treat, ref = 5) | id + time, data = data)
iplot(event_study, main = "Event Study: Effects over Time")
```

- `i(time, treat, ref = 5)` creates relative time indicators for treated units with a reference period (e.g., `time = 5`).

### Summary
This step-by-step approach helps you:
1. Estimate the core DiD model.
2. Test for parallel trends.
3. Perform placebo checks.
4. Analyze heterogeneous treatment effects.
5. Visualize dynamic effects using an event study.

Adapt the code and variables to match your specific dataset and research question.

Usage - Table output formatting
user: In my current script, is there a way to not show decimal points:

# Summary statistics for total rides, mean monthly ridership, and number of bikeways
summary_stats <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(treatment, period) %>%
  summarise(
    total_rides = sum(monthly_rides, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_rides_adj = mean(monthly_rides_adj, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_bikeways = n_distinct(bikeway_id),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = period,
    values_from = c(total_rides, mean_rides_adj, n_bikeways),
    names_glue = "{.value}_{period}"
  )

# Distribution of infrastructure types
infra_dist <- analysis_data %>%
  filter(period %in% c("pre", "post")) %>% # Focus on pre/post periods
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    protected = mean(bikeway_type == "Protected Lanes", na.rm = TRUE),
    onroad = mean(bikeway_type == "On-Road Lanes", na.rm = TRUE),
    shared = mean(bikeway_type == "Shared Roadways", na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Combine statistics and infrastructure distributions
final_table <- summary_stats %>%
  left_join(infra_dist, by = "treatment") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -treatment,
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = treatment,
    values_from = value,
    names_prefix = "Group_"
  ) %>%
  rename(
    Metric = metric,
    Control = Group_FALSE,
    Treatment = Group_TRUE
  )

final_table <- final_table %>%
  mutate(
    Metric = case_when(
      Metric == "total_rides_post" ~ "Total Rides (Post)",
      Metric == "total_rides_pre" ~ "Total Rides (Pre)",
      Metric == "total_rides_treatment" ~ "Total Rides (Treatment)",
      Metric == "mean_rides_adj_post" ~ "Mean Rides Adjusted (Post)",
      Metric == "mean_rides_adj_pre" ~ "Mean Rides Adjusted (Pre)",
      Metric == "mean_rides_adj_treatment" ~ "Mean Rides Adjusted (Treatment)",
      Metric == "n_bikeways_post" ~ "Number of Bikeways (Post)",
      Metric == "n_bikeways_pre" ~ "Number of Bikeways (Pre)",
      Metric == "n_bikeways_treatment" ~ "Number of Bikeways (Treatment)",
      Metric == "protected" ~ "Protected Lanes",
      Metric == "onroad" ~ "On-Road Lanes",
      Metric == "shared" ~ "Shared Roadways",
      TRUE ~ Metric
    )
  )
    
# Format and display the table
final_table %>%
  mutate(across(c(Control, Treatment), ~ round(.x, 2))) %>%
  kable(
    format = "pipe",
    col.names = c("Metric", "Control Group", "Treatment Group"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
  
LLM: To remove decimal points entirely, you can update the `round()` function to `round(.x, 0)` (rounding to 0 decimal places) in the final `mutate` step of your script. Here's the updated script:

```r
# Format and display the table without decimal points
final_table %>%
  mutate(across(c(Control, Treatment), ~ round(.x, 0))) %>%  # Round to 0 decimal places
  kable(
    format = "pipe",
    col.names = c("Metric", "Control Group", "Treatment Group"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")  # Add commas for large numbers
  )
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Rounding to 0 Decimal Points**:
   - Changed `round(.x, 2)` to `round(.x, 0)` to remove decimal points completely.
   
2. **Comma Formatting**:
   - Retained `format.args = list(big.mark = ",")` in the `kable()` function to display large numbers with commas for readability.

This will output a table with integer values (no decimals) and formatted with commas.

Usage - Formatting model output
User: In foels fixset R, the modelsummary() funciotn, how can I make it so that the standard error shown below the coefficient, has its own column?

LLM: In R, the `modelsummary` package is highly customizable. If you want the standard errors to appear in their own column rather than below the coefficients, you can achieve this by customizing the `modelsummary()` call with the `estimate` argument, or by using the `glance_custom()` function from the same package.

Here’s how you can separate the coefficients and standard errors into their own columns:

### Example Code

```R
library(modelsummary)
library(fixest)

# Example model
data(mtcars)
model <- feols(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)

# Custom table with separate columns for coefficients and standard errors
modelsummary(
  model,
  estimate = "{estimate} ({std.error})",
  statistic = NULL,
  coef_omit = NULL,
  gof_omit = NULL,
  fmt = 3
)
```

### Explanation
1. **`estimate` Argument:**
   - You can format how the coefficients and standard errors appear by customizing the `estimate` string. The default behavior places the standard errors in parentheses below the coefficient.
   - By using `{estimate}` and `{std.error}`, you can control where these values appear.

2. **Separate Column:** 
   - To make the standard error appear in a separate column, you would usually need to format the data frame for display purposes and split the values into separate fields.

### Advanced (Manual Column Separation)
If the above customization does not fully separate them, you can manipulate the data table extracted from `modelsummary` directly.

For example:

```R
# Extract tidy output
library(broom)
tidy_model <- broom::tidy(model)

# Create a new data frame
tidy_table <- data.frame(
  Term = tidy_model$term,
  Coefficient = tidy_model$estimate,
  Std_Error = tidy_model$std.error
)

# Display table using kable, xtable, etc.
print(tidy_table)
```
