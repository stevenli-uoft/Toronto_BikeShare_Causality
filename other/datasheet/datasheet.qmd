abstract: "This datasheet documents the creation and composition of a dataset analyzing the causal impact of cycling infrastructure improvements on Bike Share Toronto ridership between 2017-2023. Following the standardized format proposed by @gebru2021datasheets, this datasheet details the processing of over 7.4 million bike share rides across 1,191 bikeways, focusing specifically on infrastructure changes during 2019-2021. The dataset combines and cleans records from Toronto's Open Data Portal, including bike share trips, station locations, and cycling infrastructure details, to create a structured dataset for difference-in-differences analysis. The final dataset contains monthly ridership metrics, infrastructure classifications, and temporal indicators designed to evaluate how protected lanes, on-road lanes, and shared roadways influence cycling activity."

    - Created by Steven Li at the University of Toronto.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - No external funding received.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - No additional comments.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each row represents a bikeway-month observation tracking ridership metrics 24-months  before and after infrastructure changes.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- 71,460 observations tracking 1,191 bikeways over 60 months each.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- Dataset includes 1,191 of the roughly 1,500 bikeways in Toronto with associated Bike Share stations within 100m, and Bike Share ridership from 2017-2023.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance contains:

    > - bikeway_id: Unique identifier for each bikeway segment
    > - construct_year: Year when the bikeway was either upgraded or newly installed
    > - period: One of three periods (pre/treatment/post) relative to infrastructure changes
    > - treatment: Boolean indicating if bikeway received improvements during 2019-2021
    > - year_month: Time variable tracking month and year
    > - calendar_year: Year of observation
    > - relative_month: Months relative to treatment (-24 to +24)
    > - bikeway_type: Infrastructure classification (Protected Lanes: Cycle tracks, multi-use trails, bi-directional cycle tracks. On-Road Lanes: Painted bike lanes. Shared Roadways: Sharrows, signed routes, park roads)
    > - sub_treatment_type: Classification of infrastructure change (Upgraded: Existing infrastructure improved. Newly-Installed: New infrastructure added. No Treatment: Control group)
    > - monthly_rides: Raw count of bike share trips starting near bikeway
    > - monthly_rides_adj: Seasonally adjusted ride count
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Treatment status (TRUE/FALSE) indicates whether bikeway received infrastructure improvements during 2019-2021.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- No missing values in final analysis dataset after cleaning.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No explicit relationships between instances.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- No recommended splits for analysis dataset.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
  - Spatial precision:

    > - Only captures rides starting within 100m of bikeways
    > - May miss riders who use bikeways but start further away
    > - Some riders within 100m may not use the adjacent bikeway

  - Temporal uncertainty:

    > - Treatment year only known to annual precision
    > - Construction/upgrade timing within year unknown
    > - Seasonal patterns affect ridership (addressed through adjustment)
  
  - Treatment classification:

    > - Control group randomly assigned to pseudo-treatment years
    > - Some bikeways may have received minor unreported improvements
    
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*

    - Sub-treatment categorized by:
  
    > - Newly-Installed: New installation of a bikeway
    > - Upgraded: Upgrades to an existing bikeway
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No individual identification possible.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
