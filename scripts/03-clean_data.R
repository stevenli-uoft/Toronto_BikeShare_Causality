####### NOTES:
# 2017-2023 rides: 21.8m rides
# Rides from 2017-2023 where start_station is near bikelane: 13.8m rides
# After joining with control and treatment bikeways, there are ~8m rides
#
# This is because, we only gather 5 year periods of data for each bikeway, since
# our analysis focused on 5 relative years, +-2 around treatment year. Each control
# bikeway will have randomly selected pseudo-treatment years, with +- 2 years.
# So because we only focus on 5 years per bikeway, it won't contain all bike rides
# For example, we randomly selected bikewayID=4 as control bikeway, with 
# pseudo-treatment year as 2020, so bikewayID=4 will have data from 2018-2022. 
# So 2017 and 2023 rides for bikewayID=4 will be dropped from final_df.
#
#
#
# For filtered rides where start and end station is near bikelane: 1.01m rides
# After joining with control and treatment bikeways, there are ~672k rides
